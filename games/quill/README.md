# go-quill

Quill is a custom Quibbble turn based strategy card game. To create your own cards head over to the [docs](./docs/) page.

## TODO
- Create trait that expires after X turns
  - Add card that gives all current player units +2 attack just this turn
- Create more fun randomness
- Create cards that have synergy together
  - Add groups field to units? Maybe this will help with building synergy 

# Ideas
- 5 columns instead of 3 and bases only have 5 health each.
  - Each base has some random bonus for destroying it.
- Add cursed X trait - take X more damage when damaged
- Add dominion trait - apply events and/or hooks when an opponent's base is down
- Add friendly fire trait - attacked by friendly unit heals it
- Add invincible X trait - cannot take damage for X turns
- Add traps - invisible units that explode and deal damage when moved over
- Add rumble - all units are moved one random space
- Add big cards like imperial resouces, god hand, necro, VD, etc
