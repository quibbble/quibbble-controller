# Quibbble Game

This package provides the scaffolding for all Quibbble games. Any game that implements this API will then be able to take full advantage of the Quibbble Controller and be run alongside any and all other Quibbble games in a K8s cluster. See [tictactoe](/games/tictactoe/) for a simple example of how to implement this API.
